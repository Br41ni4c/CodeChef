The logic here is to get the number of characteristics(*N*), the minimum number of characteristics for satsifying similarity(*X*) and the maximum permissible difference to deem a characteristic as similar(*K*).

We have 2 arrays for getting the value of characteristics for ROSS and RUSS respectively.
Now we use a loop to iterate through the arrays and check whether the difference in values of elements of respective indices i.e., |A<sub>j</sub>-B<sub>j</sub>| is lesser than the *K*.
If so we increment a counter element *c*.  

If the value of *c* exceeds *X* we print "YES". Else we print "NO".

For example:
1. Let's consider this test case   
4 2 2   
1 7 7 5   
1 8 1 2  
>- Here the number of characteristics i.e., *N* is 4.
>- The minimum number of characteristics for for satisfying similarity i.e., *X* is 2.
>- And the maximum permissible difference i.e., *K* is 2.

Now lets initialize *c* as 0.  
Here, when j=0, A<sub>j</sub> = 1 and B<sub>j</sub> = 1. => |A<sub>j</sub>-B<sub>j</sub>| = 0 which is less than *K*. Therefore, *c* is incremented  as 1.
When j=1, A<sub>j</sub> = 7 and B<sub>j</sub> = 8. => |A<sub>j</sub>-B<sub>j</sub>| = 1 which is less than *K*. Therefore, *c* is incremented  as 2.
When j=2, A<sub>j</sub> = 7 and B<sub>j</sub> = 1. => |A<sub>j</sub>-B<sub>j</sub>| = 6 which is greater than *K*. 
When j=3, A<sub>j</sub> = 5 and B<sub>j</sub> = 2. => |A<sub>j</sub>-B<sub>j</sub>| = 3 which is greater than *K*.  
We have exhausted the list and finally the value of *c*
