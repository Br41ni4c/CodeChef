The logic here is to get the number of characteristics(*N*), the minimum number of characteristics for satsifying similarity(*X*) and the maximum permissible difference to deem a characteristic as similar(*K*).

We have 2 arrays for getting the value of characteristics for ROSS and RUSS respectively.
Now we use a loop to iterate through the arrays and check whether the difference in values of elements of respective indices i.e., |A<sub>j</sub>-B<sub>j</sub>| is lesser than the *K*.
If so we increment a counter element *c*.  

If the value of *c* exceeds *X* we print "YES". Else we print "NO".

For example:
Let's consider this test case
4 2 2
1 7 7 5
1 8 1 2
- Here the number of characteristics i.e., *N* is 4.
