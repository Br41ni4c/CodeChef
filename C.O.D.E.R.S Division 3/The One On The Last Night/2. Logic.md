in this question for each test case, we are given the original number(*N*) and the number of manipulations that are allowed on a card(*K*) before Joey notices it.

After observing the sample test cases, we can see that each time, the smallest digit in the given number is incremented. 

For this, let's take the given number and split it into a list of it's digits. Now we have to sort the array and increment the first index value. After this we again sort the array and increment the first index value and we repeat this process till the maximum number of changes is reached.  
**Note:** This is valid as long as the minimum number of the list isn't a '9' in which case we break the loop.

Now we iterate through the list and multiply each element of the list to the product variable (which was initially equal to 1).

### Finally the product variable is printed.

For example:  
Let's consider the test case  
54729 3  
- First step is to create an array of the digits in *N* which is li = [5, 4, 2, 7, 9]
- Next is to sort the array, which gives us li = [2, 4, 5, 7, 9]
- Now we increment the first element of the array and decrement the value of *K*. So li = [3, 4, 5, 7, 9] and *K* = 2. 
- Now we sort the array again, increment the first element asnd decrement the value of *K*. So li = [3, 4, 5, 7, 9] (after sorting), li = [4, 4, 5, 7, 9] (after incrementing) and *K* = 1.
