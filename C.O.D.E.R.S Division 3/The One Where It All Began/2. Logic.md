According to the question, there are 6 friends and *N* cookies and the *N* cookies are supposed to be distributed to the 6 friends in such a manner that:
- Each friend gets at least 1 cookie
- No 2 friends get the same number of cookies

So the minimum value which satisfies the given conditions is 21 (the sum of the first 6 distinct natural numbers) where:
- 1<sup>st</sup> friend gets 1 cookie 
- 2<sup>nd</sup> friend gets 2 cookies
- 3<sup>rd</sup> friend gets 3 cookies
- 4<sup>th</sup> friend gets 4 cookies
- 5<sup>th</sup> friend gets 5 cookies
- 6<sup>th</sup> friend gets 6 cookies 

Therefore, 1+2+3+4+5+6 = 21

Now for any value greater than 21, we can give the additional number of cookies to the 6th friend and the conditions will still be satisfied  
For eg.
- If N = 73, first 5 friends get 1,2,3,4,5 respectively and the last friend gets the remainder i.e., 58 cookies. 
- if N = 1000, again the first 5 friends get 1,2,3,4,5 respectively and the 6<sup>th</sup> friend gets 985 cookies.

Now although this manner of dividing cookies seems unfair, the conditions are satisfied in the given cases.

### Conclusion: Therefore, any value of *N* greater than 20 is acceptable
